The carsimr.Thota package simulates the movement of blue and red cars on a grid. Cars are randomly distributed based on a specified proportion or number. In each trial, blue cars move upwards while red cars move to the right, alternating between trails. The movement continues in a circular order.

## Installation

You can install the development version of carsimr.Thota from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("saichan0529/carsimr.Thota")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(carsimr.Thota)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

Initialize a Grid: To initialize a grid with a specified proportion of blue cars and move them, you can use the initialize_grid function. Here's an example:

Initialize a grid with 20% of cars (rho = 0.2) with 50% probability of blue cars, prob_blue = 0.5 and dimensions 10x10

```{r example for initializing grid}
grid <- initialize_grid(rho = 0.2, dims = c(10, 10), prob_blue = 0.5)
```
Print the initialized grid
```{r}
grid
```

Move Cars: To move the cars on the grid, you can use the move_cars function. Here's an example:

```{r Move the cars on the grid for 5 trials }
moved_grid <- move_cars(grid, trials = 5)
```

Print the moved grid
```{r}
moved_grid
```

Plot Cars: You can visualize the cars on the grid using the plot function. 

```{r}
plot(moved_grid, pause = .9)
```
